I am a Bachelor’s student in Biotechnology at Purbanchal University, with a strong academic foundation in molecular biology, genetics, microbiology, biochemistry, and bioprocess technology. My studies combine theoretical knowledge with practical laboratory experience, strengthening my interest in research and applied biotechnology.

I am deeply passionate about biotechnology and its role in advancing healthcare and sustainable solutions. Beyond academics, I enjoy drawing and art, watching anime, and writing blogs, where I explore ideas related to science, creativity, and personal growth.
